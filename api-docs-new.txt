  COLLEGEHUB — WHAT WE BUILT
  A smart academic platform for college students and faculty
================================================================================

CollegeHub is an all-in-one digital campus platform that connects students,
faculty, and administration in one place. It handles everything from real-time
group chats and quiz competitions to AI-powered study tools and campus events —
all built around the structure of a real college.


  WHO USES IT


  Students   — The primary users. Can join groups, chat, take quizzes,
               explore clubs, use AI tools, and share resources.

  Faculty    — Can create quizzes, upload study material, manage clubs,
               organise events, and view student data.

  Admin      — Full platform oversight, can view all statistics and
               manage the entire system.


  FEATURES



1. ACCOUNTS & PROFILES


  Every user registers with an email, password, and role.

  Students fill out a profile with:
    - Branch, year, and section (e.g. CSE, Year 2, Section A)
    - Roll number
    - Skills and interests
    - Resume link (Google Drive)
    - Portfolio link (Google Drive)
    - Profile picture

  When a student creates their profile, the system automatically places them
  into the correct academic groups — one for their whole year (e.g. CSE-2)
  and one for their section (e.g. CSE-2-A). No manual setup needed.

  Faculty can search and view all student profiles, filtered by year,
  section, or branch. They can also download a full student list as a
  spreadsheet (CSV) — with optional filters like "only students who have
  uploaded a resume."


2. ACADEMIC GROUPS & GROUP CHAT


  Groups are the core of CollegeHub. Every student is automatically in two
  groups: their year group and their section group.

  Inside each group, members can:
    - Chat in real time (messages appear instantly, no page refresh needed)
    - Send images in chat
    - Edit or delete their own messages
    - See all previous messages in order

  Faculty and admins can read all group chats and moderate content.
  Real-time messaging is powered by Socket.IO (like WhatsApp Web).


3. DISCUSSION THREADS


  Inside any group, students can post a discussion thread — a structured
  question or topic with a title, description, and subject tag (like a
  mini Stack Overflow for each class).

  Others in the group can reply. The thread author (or faculty/admin) can
  mark the thread as "resolved" once answered. The best reply can be
  "accepted" to highlight it as the solution.

  Faculty can also trigger an AI-generated suggested answer for any thread
  with a single click (see AI Features below).


4. REAL-TIME QUIZZES


  Faculty create multiple-choice quizzes with a time limit per question.
  Students join and compete live — questions are pushed to everyone at the
  same time, scores are calculated instantly, and a leaderboard is shown
  at the end. The whole experience is real-time (Socket.IO), so it feels
  like a live game show.

  Quiz results are stored and visible in each student's dashboard
  (last 5 quiz scores with time taken).


5. ACADEMIC RESOURCES


  Faculty can upload study materials — PDFs of notes, past papers, and
  reference documents — directly to a group. Students in the group can
  browse, search, and download those files at any time.

  Files are stored securely on the server. Searches work by subject name,
  file type, exam year, or any keyword.


6. CAMPUS FORUMS


  The forums are a campus-wide discussion board — not limited to any one
  group. Anyone can post a thread on any topic and the entire college
  community can participate.

  Features:
    - Post a forum thread with a title, description, topic tag, and hashtags
    - Edit or delete your own posts
    - Reply to threads (and reply to replies — nested conversations)
    - Like or dislike any post or reply
    - Search by keyword (partial matches work — "vi" finds "vibe coding")
    - Filter by topic or see only your own posts

  This is a pure REST system — no live connection needed, just refresh
  to see new posts.


7. CLUBS


  Students can browse and join college clubs (Tech, Cultural, Sports, Social,
  etc.). Faculty can create clubs and assign co-leaders from among the members.

  Club features:
    - Create a club with a name, description, logo, category, and tags
    - Students join or leave clubs freely
    - Club leaders can promote members, kick members, and transfer leadership
    - Each club can host its own events (see Events below)
    - Faculty/admin can manage clubs they lead


8. EVENTS


  Faculty and admins can create events that target:
    - The whole college (e.g. Annual Tech Fest)
    - A specific academic group (e.g. Guest lecture for CSE-3)
    - A specific club (e.g. Football club match)

  Events include a title, date, time, venue, description, poster image,
  and tags. Students can RSVP to mark their attendance.

  When an event is created, automatic notifications are sent to everyone
  it targets — college-wide events reach all users, group events reach
  group members, club events reach club members.


9. NOTIFICATIONS


  Users receive in-app notifications for:
    - Quiz starting in their group
    - New events (college, group, or club)

  Notifications can be marked as read one-by-one or all at once.
  An unread count is always available for the notification bell icon.


10. AI-POWERED STUDY TOOLS


  CollegeHub's AI features are powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.
  Every tool is personalised and responds in seconds.

  a) SKILL ROADMAP GENERATOR
     Tell the AI a skill you want to learn (e.g. "Machine Learning" or
     "Web Development") and it builds a complete, phase-by-phase learning
     plan with topics, resources, and projects. Saved to your account.

  b) WEEKLY STUDY PLAN BUILDER
     Enter your subjects, exam date, and available hours per day. The AI
     creates a full week-by-week schedule with daily tasks and a revision
     strategy. Saved to your account.

  c) DOUBT ASSISTANT (Thread-based)
     On any group discussion thread, tap "Ask AI" and the AI reads the
     question plus all existing replies, then suggests a clear answer. Good
     for teachers who want a quick draft answer, or students stuck on a topic.

  d) RESOURCE RECOMMENDATIONS
     Students get 10 personalised learning resources (videos, courses,
     articles, tools) based on their branch, year, skills, and interests.
     All free resources are marked clearly.

  e) PERFORMANCE-BASED STUDY SUGGESTIONS
     Submit your weak subjects and recent scores. The AI analyses the
     pattern and gives a targeted improvement plan for each subject with
     specific strategies, recommended resources, and a weekly hour budget.

  f) AI DOUBT CHAT (Conversational Tutor)
     A persistent, multi-turn chat with an AI academic tutor. Like ChatGPT
     but focused on academic help. Ask follow-up questions — the AI
     remembers the whole conversation. Students can clear the history
     anytime to start fresh.


11. DASHBOARD


  Every user sees a personalised dashboard when they log in. It adapts
  based on their role.

  Student dashboard shows:
    - Profile summary, groups, and clubs
    - Recent quiz scores with performance stats (last 5 quizzes)
    - Quick links to key features
    - Study tips and trending forum topics
    - Upcoming events on campus

  Faculty dashboard shows:
    - Clubs they lead
    - Recent quizzes created (with participant counts)
    - Platform-wide stats (total students, groups, events organised)
    - Quick links to create quizzes, upload resources, and manage events

  Admin dashboard shows:
    - Full platform statistics (users, groups, clubs, events, quizzes,
      resources, forums, notifications — all broken down)
    - Recent user signups

  Everyone sees:
    - Campus announcements
    - Academic calendar (key dates for the semester)
    - Upcoming events (next 5, with RSVP status)
    - Unread notification count


12. IDENTITY SAFETY (Deepfake Detection — Planned Integration)


  Profile picture uploads can be run through a deepfake detection API.
  Any AI-generated or manipulated face photo gets flagged automatically,
  ensuring that the college directory shows real identities.
  This helps maintain trust between students and faculty on the platform.
